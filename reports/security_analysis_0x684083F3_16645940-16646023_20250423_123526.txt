# Security Incident Analysis Report

## Vulnerability Summary

The vulnerability exists in the `TimeOwnedUpgradeabilityProxy` contract (`0x194fc30f9eeba9ad673413629b47fc00e71d90df`), specifically related to the `fallback` function. This function delegates calls to the implementation contract without checking the expiration time. This allows bypassing the intended time-based restriction on upgrades, which is enforced in the `upgradeTo` function, but only when called directly.

## Contract Analysis

- **Target Contract:** `TimeOwnedUpgradeabilityProxy` (part of contract `0x194fc30f9eeba9ad673413629b47fc00e71d90df`), particularly the `fallback` and `upgradeTo` functions.

  The `upgradeTo` function has a time-based check:

  ```solidity
    function upgradeTo(address implementation) public onlyProxyOwner {
        require(block.timestamp < expiration(), "after expiration date");
        super.upgradeTo(implementation);
    }
  ```

  The `fallback` function, which delegates calls to the implementation without any checks:

  ```solidity
    function() external payable {
        bytes32 position = implementationPosition;

        assembly {
            let ptr := mload(0x40)
            calldatacopy(ptr, returndatasize, calldatasize)
            let result := delegatecall(gas, sload(position), ptr, calldatasize, returndatasize, returndatasize)
            returndatacopy(ptr, 0, returndatasize)

            switch result
            case 0 { revert(ptr, returndatasize) }
            default { return(ptr, returndatasize) }
        }
    }
  ```

- **Attacker Contract(s):**  No specific attacker contract is provided. Any address with `proxyOwner` privileges could exploit this.

## Attack Chain Reconstruction

Because there is no specific attack transaction reported, it is impossible to provide concrete transaction details. However, the following attack chain is based on the code analysis:

1.  The `TimeOwnedUpgradeabilityProxy` contract is deployed, setting an `expiration` time in the future.
2.  After the `expiration` time has passed, an attacker (who is the `proxyOwner`) crafts a call to the `upgradeTo` function, but *through* the `fallback` function using `delegatecall`.
3.  Because the `fallback` function does not check the `expiration` time, it delegates the call to the implementation contract's `upgradeTo` function.
4.  The `upgradeTo` function then executes *within the storage context of the proxy*, successfully modifying the `implementationPosition`.

## Exploitation Mechanism

The exploitation mechanism relies on the `fallback` function delegating calls without any time check. The `upgradeTo` function *does* have a time check: `require(block.timestamp < expiration(), "after expiration date");`. However, since the `fallback` delegates *all* calls and `delegatecall` preserves `msg.sender` and storage, an attacker can call `upgradeTo` *through* the fallback, bypassing the time check. The subsequent call to `_setImplementation` will then successfully change the implementation address.

## Root Cause

The root cause is the inconsistent application of the time-based restriction. The `expiration` check is present in the `upgradeTo` function, but it's absent in the `fallback` function, allowing direct calls to the implementation contract after the time lock should have prevented upgrades.

## Security Recommendations

1.  **Implement Time Check in Fallback:** The `fallback` function should include a check to ensure that the current `block.timestamp` is less than the `expiration` time. This will prevent upgrades through `delegatecall` after the expiration.

```solidity
    function() external payable {
        require(block.timestamp < expiration(), "after expiration date"); // ADD THIS LINE
        bytes32 position = implementationPosition;

        assembly {
            let ptr := mload(0x40)
            calldatacopy(ptr, returndatasize, calldatasize)
            let result := delegatecall(gas, sload(position), ptr, calldatasize, returndatasize, returndatasize)
            returndatacopy(ptr, 0, returndatasize)

            switch result
            case 0 { revert(ptr, returndatasize) }
            default { return(ptr, returndatasize) }
        }
    }
```
