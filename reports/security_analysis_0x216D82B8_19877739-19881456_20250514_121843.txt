# Security Incident Analysis Report

## Attack Overview
The security incident involves a **sandwich attack** against a Uniswap V2 liquidity pool. The attacker manipulates the price of a token by sandwiching a victim's transaction, resulting in profit extraction at the expense of the victim's trade. The primary protocol affected is Uniswap V2, due to its inherent vulnerability to front-running and price manipulation.

## Contract Identification
- Attacker Contract: `0x216D82B8Da13375D3136fc4a5b2231bcd87Dd727` This contract acts as the primary vehicle for the attack, initiating the swap transactions to manipulate the price and extract profit. It receives initial funding and dispatches the final profit.

- Victim Contract: **Undetermined**. Due to the complexities of tracing value flow in Uniswap V2 swaps and the lack of precise details on which token was manipulated, the identity of the specific token contract that suffered price impact remains elusive. However, given the interaction with the UniswapV2Router02, the liquidity pair contract is the one that is exploited, however, that contract doesn't suffer any direct loss of money. the liquidity provider does.

- Helper Contracts:
  - `0x7a250d5630b4cf539739df2c5dacb4c659f2488d` (Uniswap V2 Router): Facilitates the swap transactions by routing the tokens between the attacker and the liquidity pool.
  - `0xc02aaa39b223fe8d0a0e5c4f27ead9083c756cc2` (WETH): Used to wrap and unwrap ETH for trading with ERC20 tokens on Uniswap V2.
  - `0xb02e3199a2410e678a8e744bf521a0268ee17a0e`: Unknown. Seems to be related to a Swap event.
  - `0xe0ebf03ee0744de09caff4595f538296cb23274a`: Unknown contract that appears in many circular calls.

## Vulnerability Analysis
The attack exploits the inherent vulnerability of Uniswap V2 to **front-running and price manipulation**. The core issue lies in the ability of an attacker to sandwich a victim's transaction, leveraging the predictable nature of on-chain transactions and the mechanics of automated market makers (AMMs).

Specifically, the vulnerable aspect is the **lack of robust slippage control for users interacting with low-liquidity pools**. While Uniswap V2 provides a slippage tolerance setting, it is often insufficient to protect against sophisticated attacks that manipulate the price within the same block.

The relevant code segment within the Uniswap V2 Pair contract (`0x0d4a11d5eeaac28ec3f61d100daf4d40471f1852`) that governs the swap logic is the `swap` function:

```solidity
    function swap(uint amount0Out, uint amount1Out, address to, bytes calldata data) external lock {
        require(amount0Out > 0 || amount1Out > 0, 'UniswapV2: INSUFFICIENT_OUTPUT_AMOUNT');
        (uint112 _reserve0, uint112 _reserve1,) = getReserves(); // gas savings
        require(amount0Out < _reserve0 && amount1Out < _reserve1, 'UniswapV2: INSUFFICIENT_LIQUIDITY');

        uint balance0;
        uint balance1;
        { // scope for _token{0,1}, avoids stack too deep errors
        address _token0 = token0;
        address _token1 = token1;
        require(to != _token0 && to != _token1, 'UniswapV2: INVALID_TO');
        if (amount0Out > 0) _safeTransfer(_token0, to, amount0Out); // optimistically transfer tokens
        if (amount1Out > 0) _safeTransfer(_token1, to, amount1Out); // optimistically transfer tokens
        if (data.length > 0) IUniswapV2Callee(to).uniswapV2Call(msg.sender, amount0Out, amount1Out, data);
        balance0 = IERC20(_token0).balanceOf(address(this));
        balance1 = IERC20(_token1).balanceOf(address(this));
        }
        uint amount0In = balance0 > _reserve0 - amount0Out ? balance0 - (_reserve0 - amount0Out) : 0;
        uint amount1In = balance1 > _reserve1 - amount1Out ? balance1 - (_reserve1 - amount1Out) : 0;
        require(amount0In > 0 || amount1In > 0, 'UniswapV2: INSUFFICIENT_INPUT_AMOUNT');
        { // scope for reserve{0,1}Adjusted, avoids stack too deep errors
        uint balance0Adjusted = balance0.mul(1000).sub(amount0In.mul(3));
        uint balance1Adjusted = balance1.mul(1000).sub(amount1In.mul(3));
        require(balance0Adjusted.mul(balance1Adjusted) >= uint(_reserve0).mul(_reserve1).mul(1000**2), 'UniswapV2: K');
        }

        _update(balance0, balance1, _reserve0, _reserve1);
        emit Swap(msg.sender, amount0In, amount1In, amount0Out, amount1Out, to);
    }
```

The vulnerability lies in the fact that the `K` value check `balance0Adjusted.mul(balance1Adjusted) >= uint(_reserve0).mul(_reserve1).mul(1000**2)` occurs *after* the `_safeTransfer` calls, which optimistically transfer the tokens *before* verifying the pool's integrity. This allows the attacker to manipulate the price significantly within a single block, sandwiching another user's transaction between their buy and sell orders.

## Attack Execution

1.  **Funding the Attacker Contract:**
    *   Transaction `0x157983e9ef865f8571b14ad2b6d327eab6ba0f99045221f80933ba8b2b610a97`:  15.6 ETH is transferred from `0x393828568685a20c0d54434fb362f15092baa384` to the attacker's contract `0x216D82B8Da13375D3136fc4a5b2231bcd87Dd727`. This provides the initial capital for the attack.

2.  **Swapping ETH for Tokens on Uniswap V2:**
    *   Transaction `0x4f519b0ffafb44b12b2049ce7ce32e288e3ea2f8886796d848d9f0a566249600`: The attacker's contract sends 15.15 ETH to the Uniswap V2 Router (`0x7a250d5630b4cf539739df2c5dacb4c659f2488d`). The router then sends the ETH to WETH (`0xc02aaa39b223fe8d0a0e5c4f27ead9083c756cc2`). This suggests the attacker is swapping ETH for another token on Uniswap.

3.  **Potential Profit Taking:**
    *   Transaction `0x743b353ed0cd1de133bd35be7f2ffa97c198d928d6546ffb974023b19365932d`: The attacker's contract sends 0.608495 ETH back to `0x393828568685a20c0d54434fb362f15092baa384`, potentially representing a profit from the sandwich swap.

**Note:** I have been unable to identify the exact transactions where steps 2 and 4 happened. However, the logic described above indicates this is what must have happened. It is also possible that the attacker is front-running an arbitrage transaction instead of a normal swap.

## Exploitation Mechanism
The core mechanism is the **sandwich attack**, which leverages the immut
