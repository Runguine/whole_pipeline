# Security Incident Analysis Report

## Attack Overview

The attack appears to be a **flash loan assisted price manipulation exploit** targeting a liquidity pool, likely on Uniswap V3. The attacker exploits a vulnerability in the pricing mechanism of the pool to drain ETH.

## Contract Identification

-   **Attacker Contract:** `0xe9626D145a2C5261070828C1a2E1a8ad47411272` - This is the contract initiating the attack, receiving initial funds and executing the swaps.

-   **Victim Contract:** `0xc36442b4a4522e871399cd717abdd847ab11fe88` -  This contract is very likely a Uniswap V3 pool. The following observations support this conclusion:
    *   Multiple transactions involve ETH being sent to this contract and then immediately to `0xc02aaa39b223fe8d0a0e5c4f27ead9083c756cc2` (WETH contract). This pattern suggests a swap on Uniswap.
    *   The attacker's interaction with this contract results in a net outflow of ETH from the contract to the attacker.
    *   The contract address `0xc36442b4a4522e871399cd717abdd847ab11fe88` is a common address used for Uniswap V3 router.

-   **Helper Contracts:**
    *   `0xb599267af569d459ca40312d3cbb57a21d3cea11` - A contract created by the attacker (`0xe9626D145a2C5261070828C1a2E1a8ad47411272`) that is later involved in delegate calls.
    *  `0xdd53e7944fbe2f0eb5c024caab96bbd5a818166c` - A contract created by the attacker (`0xe9626D145a2C5261070828C1a2E1a8ad47411272`) that is later involved in delegate calls.
    *   `0x3c147fae8ffdcd8051efd15bc1f8fda64539be3e` - A contract created by the attacker (`0xe9626D145a2C5261070828C1a2E1a8ad47411272`) that is later involved in value transfers.
    *   `0xacab5cc36f86cb9bed08d7b33a2aa69acee6a1c8` - A Proxy contract pointing to a potentially malicious implementation.

## Vulnerability Analysis

Based on the available code, the vulnerability likely lies in the **price calculation and manipulation during the swap function** of the Uniswap V3 pool (`0xc36442b4a4522e871399cd717abdd847ab11fe88`).

The core issue is that the attacker can use a large amount of ETH (likely acquired through a flash loan) to significantly alter the pool's price ratio. This price distortion allows them to then perform a reverse swap (WETH back to ETH) at an advantageous rate, draining ETH from the pool.

**Specific code segments susceptible to vulnerability (hypothetical based on Uniswap V3 architecture):**

```solidity
// Hypothetical snippet from a Uniswap V3 pool contract

function swap(address recipient, bool zeroForOne, uint256 amountIn, uint256 sqrtPriceLimitX96) external returns (uint256 amountOut) {
    // ... (code to validate input and calculate the swap) ...

    // Calculate the new sqrtPriceX96 after the swap
    (sqrtPriceX96, amountOut) = computeSwapStep(
        sqrtPriceX96,
        liquidity,
        amountRemaining,
        feePips
    );

    // ... (code to update the pool state and transfer tokens) ...
}

function computeSwapStep(uint256 sqrtPriceX96, uint128 liquidity, uint256 amountRemaining, uint24 feePips) internal returns (uint256 newSqrtPriceX96, uint256 amountOut) {
        //  ... (vulnerable code here that can be gamed with large amountIn) ...
}
```

**Explanation of the vulnerable areas:**

*   **`swap()` function:** This function is the entry point for trading tokens.  A large `amountIn` can cause significant slippage, changing the `sqrtPriceX96`.
*   **`computeSwapStep()` function:** This function calculates the price impact of the swap. If the logic here doesn't properly account for extremely large swaps, it can lead to inaccurate price calculations and a significant imbalance in the pool.

## Attack Execution

1.  **Initial Funding**: Transaction `0x202addc74544531172ce2b5b8e8a1395672aa56603e9b6358a1c92b336d839fd` transfers 57 ETH to the attacker contract (`0xe9626D145a2C5261070828C1a2E1a8ad47411272`). This suggests the attacker is using external funds, which could be a flashloan.\
    *   `0xacab5cc36f86cb9bed08d7b33a2aa69acee6a1c8` transfers 57 ETH to `0xe9626d145a2c5261070828c1a2e1a8ad47411272`.

2.  **Price Manipulation:** Transaction `0xb0dd30a66f2f6a39cb1b23b31e81ec51057be328f2b9b41995dc11fb0c7c28cb` shows the attacker's contract sending 29.1 ETH to `0xc36442b4a4522e871399cd717abdd847ab11fe88`.
    *   `0xe9626d145a2c5261070828c1a2e1a8ad47411272` transfers 29.1 ETH to `0xc36442b4a4522e871399cd717abdd847ab11fe88`.
    *   `0xc36442b4a4522e871399cd717abdd847ab11fe88` then transfers 29.1 ETH to `0xc02aaa39b223fe8d0a0e5c4f27ead9083c756cc2` (WETH), indicating a swap for WETH.

3.  **Profit Extraction:** Transaction `0x9aea20364d8348a32d3e9aefec42d01d92a11a9b3c6f6ff0f571803723b04563` shows the attacker's contract receiving 14.458581 ETH from `0xc36442b4a4522e871399cd717abdd847ab11fe88`, completing the profit-making reverse swap.

4.  **Profit Distribution:** Post-exploit, the attacker distributes the stolen ETH to other addresses (as seen in multiple subsequent transactions). For example, in transactions `0xab62fa10756d2ee5225c04dc819edfc0d7af7812c99247b7eebda36054043b24` and `0xf9d1dc4cfc1740319229f16028e0efc26868dcdce327859ffc68
