# Security Incident Analysis Report

## Attack Overview

The report analyzes a potential price manipulation exploit, possibly a rugpull or an MEV attack involving Uniswap V2 and a token locking contract. The attacker's contract (`0x216D82B8Da13375D3136fc4a5b2231bcd87Dd727`) interacts with Uniswap V2 after receiving a significant amount of ETH from `0x393828568685a20c0d54434fb362f15092baa384`.

## Contract Identification

-   Attacker Contract: `0x216D82B8Da13375D3136fc4a5b2231bcd87Dd727`
    *   This contract is likely controlled by the attacker and used to initiate the exploit. It receives ETH and interacts with Uniswap.

-   Victim Contract: `0xe900e6897db0af429bca77277979f4ea07662a2c` (LockToken)
    *   This is a token locking contract, which allows users to lock their tokens for a specific amount of time. The contract is vulnerable to price manipulation attack by attacker.
    *   The exact vulnerability is in the `_chargeFees` function. Due to insufficient validation of the `priceEstimator` contract, an attacker can set the `priceEstimator` to a malicious address. This malicious `priceEstimator` can return an incorrect ETH price for the locked token which allows an attacker to bypass the fee mechanism.

    *   The attacker can also whitelist themselves through `updateWhitelist` which bypasses the fee mechanism.

-   Helper Contracts:
    *   `0xe0ebf03ee0744de09caff4595f538296cb23274a` - This is a token contract which is created by attacker, and likely used in the exploit.
    *   `0x7a250d5630b4cf539739df2c5dacb4c659f2488d` - UniswapV2 Router to perform the swap.
    *   `0xc02aaa39b223fe8d0a0e5c4f27ead9083c756cc2` - WETH contract.

## Vulnerability Analysis

The `LockToken` contract (`0xe900e6897db0af429bca77277979f4ea07662a2c`) is vulnerable due to the following issues:

1.  **Unvalidated Price Estimator:** The `setFeeParams` function allows the owner to set the `priceEstimator` address. However, there is no check to ensure that the provided address is a legitimate price estimator contract or that it will return correct values. This allows the owner to set a malicious contract as the price estimator.

```solidity
    function setFeeParams(address _priceEstimator, address _usdTokenAddress, uint256 _feesInUSD, address payable _companyWallet)
    external
    onlyOwner
    onlyContract(_priceEstimator)
    onlyContract(_usdTokenAddress)
    {
        require(_feesInUSD > 0, "fees should be greater than 0");
        require(_companyWallet != address(0), "Invalid wallet address");
        priceEstimator = IPriceEstimator(_priceEstimator);
        usdTokenAddress = _usdTokenAddress;
        feesInUSD = _feesInUSD;
        companyWallet = _companyWallet;
        emit FeesChanged(_feesInUSD);
    }
```

2.  **ByPassing Fees:** The `updateWhitelist` function allows the owner or whitelist admin to add or remove wallets from the whitelist. If a wallet is whitelisted, it bypasses the fee mechanism. This allows the owner or a malicious whitelist admin to bypass the fee mechanism for certain wallets.

```solidity
    function updateWhitelist(address wallet, bool noFee)
    external
    {
        require(
            (whitelistAdmins[_msgSender()] || owner() == _msgSender()),
            "Caller is not authorized to whitelist"
        );
        whitelistedWallets[wallet] = noFee;
        emit WhiteListUpdated(wallet, noFee);
    }
```

3.  **Inaccurate Fee Calculation:** The `getFeesInETH` function is used to calculate the amount of ETH required for fees. If the `priceEstimator` is manipulated, this calculation will be incorrect.

```solidity
    function getFeesInETH(address _tokenAddress)
    public
    view
    returns (uint256)
    {
        //token listed free or fee params not set
        if (whitelistedWallets[_msgSender()] || 
            isFreeToken(_tokenAddress) ||
            feesInUSD == 0 ||
            address(priceEstimator) == address(0) ||
            usdTokenAddress == address(0) 
            )
        {
            return 0;
        }
        else 
        {
            //price should be estimated by 1 token because Uniswap algo changes price based on large amount
            uint256 tokenBits = 10 ** uint256(IERC20Extended(usdTokenAddress).decimals());

            uint256 estFeesInEthPerUnit = priceEstimator.getEstimatedETHforERC20(tokenBits, usdTokenAddress)[0];
            //subtract uniswap 0.30% fees
            //_uniswapFeePercentage is a percentage expressed in 1/10 (a tenth) of a percent hence we divide by 1000
            estFeesInEthPerUnit = estFeesInEthPerUnit.sub(estFeesInEthPerUnit.mul(3).div(1000));

            uint256 feesInEth = feesInUSD.mul(estFeesInEthPerUnit).div(tokenBits);
            return feesInEth;
        }
    }
```

## Attack Execution

1.  **Setting Malicious Price Estimator:** The attacker (or the contract owner) calls `setFeeParams` to set `priceEstimator` to a malicious contract `0xe0ebf03ee0744de09caff4595f538296cb23274a` or whitelist their wallet through `updateWhitelist`.
2.  **Locking Tokens:** The attacker calls `lockToken` to lock tokens, bypassing the intended fees due to the manipulated `priceEstimator` or whitelisting.
3.  **Price Manipulation (Optional):** In some instances, the attacker uses Uniswap to manipulate the price of the locked token.
4.  **Withdrawal:** After the lock period, the attacker calls `withdrawTokens` to withdraw the tokens.

## Exploitation Mechanism

The attacker exploits the lack of validation on `priceEstimator` in the `LockToken` contract. By pointing `priceEstimator` to a malicious contract, the attacker can control the value returned by `getFeesInETH`. This allows the attacker to bypass the fee mechanism of `lockToken`.

## Impact Assessment

The impact is a loss of revenue for the LockToken contract since the attacker is not paying the appropriate fees. This could result in a significant financial loss for the contract owner and a loss of trust in the protocol.

## Prevention Measures

1.  **Validate Price Estimator:** Add checks to the `setFeeParams` function to ensure that the `priceEstimator` contract is a trusted price oracle. This can be done by checking for specific functions or interfaces on the contract.

```solidity
    function setFeeParams(address _priceEstimator, address _usdTokenAddress, uint256 _feesInUSD, address payable _companyWallet)
    external
    onlyOwner
    onlyContract(_priceEstimator)
    onlyContract(_usdTokenAddress)
    {
        require(_feesInUSD > 0, "fees should be greater than 0");
        require(_companyWallet != address(0), "Invalid wallet address");
        // Add a check to ensure that the priceEstimator is a trusted source
        require(IPriceEstimator(_priceEstimator).getEstimatedETHforERC20(1, usdTokenAddress).length > 0, "Invalid price estimator");
        priceEstimator = IPriceEstimator(_priceEstimator);
        usdTokenAddress = _usdTokenAddress;
        feesInUSD = _feesInUSD;
        companyWallet = _companyWallet;
        emit FeesChanged(_feesInUSD);
    }
```

2.  **Remove or Restrict Whitelisting:** The `updateWhitelist` function should be removed or restricted to only the contract owner. If it must be used, add checks to ensure that the whitelist admins are trusted and that whitel
