# Security Incident Analysis Report

## Attack Overview

The attack involves the exploitation of a vulnerability within a staking contract (`0x8a30d684b1d3f8f36b36887a3deca0ef2a36a8e3`) that allows an attacker to withdraw more funds than they are entitled to. The attacker leverages a proxy contract (`0x81ad996ac000d5dfdc65880a9e4ee487629375c4`) and their own contract (`0x954386cb43dd2f0f637710a10f6b2d0f86aacb97`) to execute the exploit, ultimately draining 102.454470 ETH.

## Contract Identification

- Attacker Contract: `0x954386cb43dd2f0f637710a10f6b2d0f86aacb97`
    - This contract receives the stolen ETH, indicating it's the attacker's primary contract.
- Victim Contract: `0x8a30d684b1d3f8f36b36887a3deca0ef2a36a8e3` (LockedStaking)
    - The ABI for this contract suggests it manages staked tokens and yield, with functions like `stake`, `unStake`, and `accountInfo`. The fact that it's a staking contract losing funds is strong evidence.
- Helper Contracts: `0x81ad996ac000d5dfdc65880a9e4ee487629375c4` (Proxy)
    - This contract acts as an intermediary, receiving WETH and then transferring it to the attacker. It also has circular calls which is often indicative of malicious and exploitative behavior.

## Vulnerability Analysis

The root cause of the vulnerability lies within the `unStake` function. The lack of code for the victim contract unfortunately makes it impossible to know the true root cause.

## Attack Execution

1.  **Preparation:** The attacker deploys contracts `0x954386cb43dd2f0f637710a10f6b2d0f86aacb97` and `0x81ad996ac000d5dfdc65880a9e4ee487629375c4`.

2.  **Deposit/Interaction with Victim:** Contract `0x81ad996ac000d5dfdc65880a9e4ee487629375c4` interacts with the victim protocol (the LockedStaking contract `0x8a30d684b1d3f8f36b36887a3deca0ef2a36a8e3`). It receives 102.454470 ETH from the WETH contract (`0xc02aaa39b223fe8d0a0e5c4f27ead9083c756cc2`). This is evidenced by transaction `0xa0dcf9b177702c58c5d0353aff2caeab12589bce204fb2d0e62ccbf5717f1798`.

3.  **Exploitation:** The attacker's contract `0x954386cb43dd2f0f637710a10f6b2d0f86aacb97` triggers the vulnerability in the victim protocol through contract `0x81ad996ac000d5dfdc65880a9e4ee487629375c4`.

4.  **Withdrawal:** Contract `0x81ad996ac000d5dfdc65880a9e4ee487629375c4` withdraws 102.454470 ETH from the victim protocol and sends it to the attacker's contract `0x954386cb43dd2f0f637710a10f6b2d0f86aacb97`. This is part of transaction `0xa0dcf9b177702c58c5d0353aff2caeab12589bce204fb2d0e62ccbf5717f1798`.

## Exploitation Mechanism

The proxy contract `0x81ad996ac000d5dfdc65880a9e4ee487629375c4` plays a critical role in enabling the attack, likely by manipulating function calls to the staking contract. Without the code for this contract, the exact mechanism remains speculative, but the behavior suggests a possible reentrancy or logic error exploitation.

## Impact Assessment

The exploit resulted in a loss of 102.454470 ETH for the victim protocol.

## Prevention Measures

Due to not having the source code for the proxy and victim contracts only general recommendations can be made:

1.  **Implement Reentrancy Guards:** Use reentrancy guards on all state-changing functions, especially those involved in transferring funds.
2.  **Input Validation:** Ensure proper validation of all inputs to prevent unexpected behavior.
3.  **Thorough Testing:** Conduct comprehensive testing, including fuzzing and formal verification, to identify potential vulnerabilities.
4.  **Code Audits:** Engage reputable security auditors to review the code for vulnerabilities.
